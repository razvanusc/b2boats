# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

  # boat = Boat.create(name: "Titanic", description: "Boat for rent", location: "Amsterdam",
  #   price_per_hour: 10, hours: 2, capacity: 200, has_license: false, user_id: 1)

  # user = User.create(first_name: "Jack", last_name: "Sparrow", email: "jacksparrow@gmail.com",
  #   password: "jacksparrow1008")

  # boat = Boat.create(name: "Titanic", description: "Boat for rent", location: "Amsterdam",
  #   price_per_hour: 10, hours: 2, capacity: 200, has_license: false, user_id: 1)
